#Installation Must 
You first have these already installed in system 
1.Numpy       2.Matplotlib        3. OpencV    but for using placeclassifier under opencv you need
to install opencv-contrib-python for using haar classifier .

4.Python

#Important change the path or directory for data set : as in my laptop i am using relative 
path as it is the safest of all like train_dir = r"C:\Users\MD HASSAN IRSHAD\Desktop\Face regonization system\dataset\train"
               test_dir = r"C:\Users\MD HASSAN IRSHAD\Desktop\Face regonization system\dataset\test"
but before using this you need to change directory path as : 1 train_dir=`dataset\\train`
     test_dir=`dataset\\test`

please download the dataset before using the model.

and also every you have to provide the image as input it will process it give the predication of assemble with dataset and detect face of image.
